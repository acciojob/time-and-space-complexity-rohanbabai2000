		All about Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>
		Time Complexity - The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies 
		the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run 
		as a function of the length of the input in an efficient way. 
		Note that the time to run is a function of the 
		length of the input and not the actual execution 
		time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p> 
		Space Complexity - Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold 
		temporary data or final result while the program is in 
		execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm 
		to solve given problem is called <b>space complexity</b> of the 
		algorithm. It is denoted by O(n).
