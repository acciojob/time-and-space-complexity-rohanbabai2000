		 Time and Space Complexity
	</h1>
	<p>
		Time Complexity - The Time Complexity of an algorithm quantifies 
		the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run 
		as a function of the length of the input in an efficient way. 
		Note that the time to run is a function of the 
		length of the input and not the actual execution 
		time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		<b>Space Complexity</b> - Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold 
		temporary data or final result while the program is in 
		execution.It is denoted by O(n).
